# Star Wars: Collect the Force
Web Game Incorporating Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery

## Background
Originally developed as a weekly homework assignment for Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, Star Wars: Collect the Force is a web game that incorporates a range of technologies. With a simple PHP scaffold, the emphasis for this project is on the use of JavaScript and jQuery, with the Bootstrap framework implemented for lightweight design.

## Game Objective
The objective of Collect the Force is to match a randomly selected value without going over the given value. "Force" values are assigned to four of the given Star Wars  characters (Rey, Finn, Poe, and BB-8). It is up to the player, using a combination of each character's individual force value, to match the selected value. The catch? Each of the four characters has a randomized force value (any number between 1 and 12), which changes between each game. If the player goes over the given value, they lose.
